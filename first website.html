	<h1>This is my first real website</h1>
	
	<p> When you make your first website, you have to think of things to say to fill the space, or pick a topic to talk about... I am very proud that I made this with no help or dictated steps, but now I must pick a topic! 
	</p>

	<p>My degree is in Materials Science, so I could do something themed around this. ALternatively, I could do something on music, or dancing, or baking... all of which are hobbies of mine!</p>
